	abstract = {Contingent negative variation ({CNV}), reaction time ({RT}), and {EEG} power spectrum were measured in a group of 27 neurotics and 26 controls subjects, male and female, aged 18 to 38. {CNV} was recorded with a 1 sec interstimulus interval and averaged over 48 trials. Two spectral analyses of the {EEG} were performed, the first during the 1 sec period preceding S1 (spontaneous {EEG}), the second during the S1–S2 interval (activated {EEG}).

For each group of subjects, we calculated the correlations between four measures of {CNV} amplitude, {RT} duration, and the relative powers of the delta, theta, alpha and beta activities during spontaneous and activated {EEG}. In neurotic subjects there was an absence of correlation between the pre- and post-imperative segments of the {CNV}, and between early {CNV} amplitude and per cent alpha power.

Both groups shared in common strong correlations relating {CNV} amplitude and {RT} length, on the one hand, and the different components of the {EEG} spectrum, on the other hand, Principal component analysis applied to the pooled data revealed different factors for {CNV} and {EEG} parameters, suggesting independence of the neurophysiological mechanisms implied in the two phenomena.},

Task effects on various {ERP} components were found in both species. Interestingly, effects on the P3 component were similar in the species with regard to amplitude: Target stimuli elicited a higher amplitude in the oddball task than did standard stimuli. This might indicate that the P3 shares the same characteristics between species. However, the first four components occurred 1.82 times earlier in rats than in humans, expecting a P3 of about 200 ms in rats. The P3 in rats appeared at 380 ms.

	abstract = {It has been known for many years that the power of beta-band oscillatory activity in motor-related brain regions decreases during the preparation and execution of voluntary movements. However, it is not clear yet whether the amplitude of this desynchronization is modulated by any parameter of the motor task. Here, we examined whether the degree of uncertainty about the upcoming movement direction modulated beta-band desynchronization during motor preparation. To this end, we recorded whole-head neuromagnetic signals while human subjects performed an instructed-delay reaching task with one, two, or three possible target directions. We found that the reduction of power of beta-band activity (16–28 Hz) during motor preparation was scaled relative to directional uncertainty. Furthermore, we show that the change of beta-band power correlates with the change of latency of response associated with response uncertainty. Finally, we show that the main source of beta-band desynchronization was located in the peri-Rolandic region. The results establish directional uncertainty as an important determinant of beta-band power during motor preparation and indicate that neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex during motor preparation covaries with directional uncertainty.},

	abstract = {It is often argued that climbing neural activity, as for example reflected by the contingent negative variation ({CNV}) in the electroencephalogram, is the signature of the subjective experience of time. According to this view, the resolution of the {CNV} coincides with termination of subjective timing processes. Paradoxically, behavioral data indicate that participants keep track of timing even after the standard interval ({SI}) has passed. This study addresses whether timing continues after {CNV} resolution. In Experiment 1, human participants were asked to discriminate time intervals while evoked potentials ({EPs}) elicited by the sound terminating a comparison interval ({CI}) were measured. As the amplitude of N1P2 components increases as a function of the temporal distance from the {SI}, and the latency of the P2 component followed the hazard rate of the {CIs}, timing processes continue after {CNV} resolution. Based on a novel experimental paradigm, statistical model comparisons and trial-by-trial analyses, Experiment 2 supports this finding as subjective time is more accurately indexed by the amplitude of early {EPs} than by {CNV} amplitude. These results provide the first direct evidence that subjective timing of multisecond intervals does not depend on climbing neural activity as indexed by the {CNV} and that the subjective experience of time is better reflected by distinct features of post-{CI} evoked potentials.},

In contrast, {EEG} led the depth {LFP} in the lower and upper beta bands. {SA} {LFP} activity in the alpha band could either lead or lag {EEG}.

In contrast, ketamine produced no change in the temporal control of behavior on either procedure.

	abstract = {Neuropsychological investigations of patients with Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, or attention deficit disorder converge with psychopharmacological studies in animals and healthy volunteers to implicate dopamine ({DA}) pathways in timing. In parallel, single-cell recording and functional neuroimaging studies have highlighted the importance of basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex, and supplementary motor area ({SMA}) for timing. In a placebo-controlled, within-subject design, we combined event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging with a {DA} manipulation (acute phenylalanine/tyrosine depletion; {APTD}) in healthy volunteers to pinpoint the neuroanatomical and functional substrates of the {DA} modulation of timing. Behaviorally, {APTD} selectively impaired accuracy of perceptual timing, with no effect on performance of a color-control task matched for difficulty, working memory ({WM}), and attentional demands. Neurally, {APTD} attenuated timing-specific activity in the putamen and {SMA}. Notably, {APTD}-induced decreases in brain activity were directly correlated to {APTD}-induced impairments in timing performance. Moreover, {APTD} modulated timing-specific activity selectively during initial storage of the sample duration, but had no effect during its subsequent retrieval or comparison to a probe. Our results do not simply reflect {DA} modulation of {WM} since the color task controlled for the {WM} updating process necessary for timing of durations in the seconds range. Moreover, preliminary evidence indicated {APTD} effects on putamen and {SMA} were greater for subsecond (540 ms) than suprasecond (1080 ms) durations, when {WM} demands would actually be lower. Instead, we show for the first time in healthy humans that {DA} manipulation perturbs timing by attenuating the activity in putamen and {SMA} that mediates initial storage of temporal information into {WM}.},

We recorded local field potentials ({LFPs}) from the region of the subthalamic nuclei of eight patients with Parkinson’s disease during the performance of a warned reaction time task in which an imperative cue instructed the subject to move or not to move. In ‘go’ trials, {LFP} activity in the beta frequency band (∼20 Hz) decreased prior to movement, with an onset latency that strongly correlated with mean reaction time across patients. This was followed by a late post‐movement increase in beta power. In contrast, in ‘nogo’ trials the beta power drop following imperative signals was prematurely terminated compared with go trials and reversed into an early beta power increase. These differences were manifest as power increases when go trials were subtracted from nogo trials. In six patients these relative beta power increases in nogo–go difference trials were of shorter latency than the respective reaction time. The findings suggest that, firstly, the subthalamic nucleus is involved in the preparation of externally paced voluntary movements in humans and, secondly, the degree of synchronization of subthalamic nucleus activity in the beta band may be an important determinant of whether motor programming and movement initiation is favoured or suppressed.},

	abstract = {This review examines {ERP} data that document the mechanisms and neural bases of time processing in the millisecond-to-minute range. Several types of {ERP} attest to the existence of timing capacities. Among them, one component of the Contingent Negative Variation ({CNV}) provides an on-line index of timing. {CNV} data strengthen the temporal accumulator concept, designed to subtend duration encoding. This conclusion is based on four main results: The positive relationship between temporal estimates and {CNV} amplitude is an index of the accumulation mechanism; the {CNV} peak is an index of time-based decision making; the {CNV} relates to temporal encoding, whereas temporal long-term memory may be linked to shifts of positive polarity; learning effects on {CNV} amplitude depend on topographic features, thus revealing functional differences among brain regions with respect to timing.

We investigated whether this accumulation is reflected in the amplitude of event-related brain potentials ({ERPs}) elicited by auditory stimuli with durations of 400–600 ms. In a duration discrimination paradigm, we found more negative amplitudes to physically identical stimuli when they were judged as longer than the memorized standard duration (500 ms) as compared to being classified as shorter. This sustained negativity was already developing during the first 100 ms after stimulus onset. It could not be explained as a bias to respond with a particular hand (lateralized readiness potential), but rather reflects a processing difference between the tones to be judged as shorter or longer. Our results are in line with models of time processing which assume that higher numbers of accumulated pulses of a temporal processor result in an increase in perceived duration.},

We found that the power of both bands and the discharge rate of cells showed an orderly change in magnitude as a function of the duration and/or the serial order of the intervals executed rhythmically. More {LFPs} were tuned to duration and/or serial order in the β- than the γ-band, although different values of preferred features were represented by single cells and by both bands. Importantly, in the {LFPs} tuned to serial order, there was a strong bias toward the continuation phase for the β-band when aligned to movements, and a bias toward the synchronization phase for the γ-band when aligned to the stimuli. Our results suggest that γ-oscillations reflect local computations associated with stimulus processing, whereas β-activity involves the entrainment of large putaminal circuits, probably in conjunction with other elements of {CBGT}, during internally driven rhythmic tapping.},

	abstract = {Here, we investigate whether the event-related desynchronization ({ERD}) of spectral components of the cortical {EEG} in the beta (13–30 Hz) frequency range may, in part, index motor selection processes. Specifically, we sought evidence for a contralaterally dominant component of the beta {ERD} that is limited to trials in which motor selection is possible prior to any imperative cue to move, with attendant behavioural advantage.
We measured reaction time and assessed the lateralization of beta {ERD} in 12 healthy volunteers as they performed pre-cued choice reaction time tasks, in which warning S1 cues were either fully predictive about the laterality of a subsequent imperative S2 signal or provided no laterality information. We calculated ‘lateralized {ERD} index’ ({LERDI}), a parallel measure to the lateralized readiness potential in the time domain.
Trials with 100\% S1–S2 congruency produced significantly shorter reaction times than trials with 50\% S1–S2 congruency, where laterality information was unreliable. Beta {LERDI} indicated significantly greater lateralisation of the {ERD} in the warning-go interval and of event-related synchronization ({ERS}) following movement in the 100\% condition than in the 50\% condition. The lateralization of the beta {ERD} with respect to hand persisted, even when subjects were instructed to make movements of opposite laterality to those prompted.
Lateralized {EEG} changes occur in the beta band in the S1–S2 interval prior to movement, but only when informative warning cues allow early motor selection, as suggested by the shortening of reaction time. Furthermore, the enhanced contralateral {ERS} with 100\% S1–S2 congruency suggests that this phenomenon is at least partly independent of afferent feedback, as the same movement was made in the 100 and 50\% conditions.
Lateralized suppression of beta power prior to externally generated movements is associated with motor selection.},

Our results confirmed previous change recognition research showing feature recognition improvement under explicit instructions to maintain binding. Color memory improved during binding, showing a reduced detrimental effect of feature similarity on retrieval, particularly when the letter served as the retrieval cue for a letter-color object. We found that feature recognition improved when two conditions were met: 1) relationships between features were to-be-remembered, and 2) the feature conjunction was relevant at test. Our results further suggest that this feature advantage arises because the encoded relationship between the features facilitates retrieval, not because features and objects are represented simultaneously in separate buffers.},

We explore the neural substrates of metrical representations of time such as duration estimation (explicit timing) or temporal expectation (implicit timing). Basal ganglia ({BG}), supplementary motor area, cerebellum, and prefrontal cortex have all been linked to the explicit estimation of duration. However, each region may have a functionally discrete role and will be differentially implicated depending upon task context. Among these, the dorsal striatum of the {BG} and, more specifically, its ascending nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway seems to be the most crucial of these regions, as shown by converging functional neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and psychopharmacological investigations in humans, as well as lesion and pharmacological studies in animals. Moreover, neuronal firing rates in both striatal and interconnected frontal areas vary as a function of duration, suggesting a neurophysiological mechanism for the representation of time in the brain, with the excitatory–inhibitory balance of interactions among distinct subtypes of striatal neuron serving to fine-tune temporal accuracy and precision.},

We hypothesise that net dopamine levels are modulated in response to salient internal and external cues. Crucially, the resulting modulation of beta activity is predictive, enabling the appropriate prospective resourcing and preparation of potential actions. Loss of dopamine, as in Parkinson's disease, annuls this function, unless net dopaminergic activity can be elevated through medication.},

The interpretation of these studies is complicated by the fact that, in a majority of studies, the {CNV} signal was obtained at a time when subjects were not only registering stimulus duration but also making decisions and preparing to act. Previously, we demonstrated that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ({rTMS}) of the right supramarginal gyrus ({rSMG}) in humans lengthened the perceived duration of a visual stimulus (Wiener et al., 2010a), suggesting the {rSMG} is involved in basic encoding processes. Here, we report a replication of this effect with simultaneous {EEG} recordings during the encoding of stimulus duration. Stimulation of the {rSMG} led to an increase in perceived duration and the amplitude of N1 and {CNV} components recorded from frontocentral sites. Furthermore, the size of the {CNV} amplitude, but not N1, positively correlated with the size of the {rTMS} effect but negatively correlated with bias (the baseline tendency to report a comparison stimulus as shorter), suggesting that the {CNV} indexes stimulus duration. These results suggest that a feedforward mechanism from parietal to prefrontal regions mediates temporal encoding and demonstrate a dissociation between early and late phases of encoding processes.},

	abstract = {The function of synchronous oscillatory activity at beta band (15–30 Hz) frequencies within the basal ganglia is unclear. Here we sought support for the hypothesis that beta activity has a global function within the basal ganglia and is not directly involved in the coding of specific biomechanical parameters of movement.
We recorded local field potential activity from the subthalamic nuclei of 11 patients with Parkinson’s disease during a synchronized tapping task at three different externally cued rates.
Beta activity was suppressed during tapping, reaching a minimum that differed little across the different tapping rates despite an increase in velocity of finger movements. Thus beta power suppression was independent of specific motor parameters. Moreover, although beta oscillations remained suppressed during all tapping rates, periods of resynchronization between taps were markedly attenuated during high rate tapping. As such, a beta rebound above baseline between taps at the lower rates was absent at the high rate.
Our results demonstrate that beta desynchronization in the region of the subthalamic nucleus is independent of motor parameters and that the beta resynchronization is differentially modulated by rate of finger tapping,
These findings implicate consistent beta suppression in the facilitation of continuous movement sequences.},

	abstract = {Tonically active neurons ({TANs}) in the monkey striatum are involved in detecting motivationally relevant stimuli. We recently provided evidence that the timing of conditioned stimuli strongly influences the responsiveness of {TANs}, the source of which is likely to be the monkey's previous experience with particular temporal regularities in sequential task events. To extend these findings, we investigated the relationship of {TAN} responses to a primary liquid reward, the timing of which is more or less predictable to the monkey either outside of a task or during instrumental task performance. Reward predictability was indexed by the timing characteristics of the mouth movements. The responsiveness of {TANs} to reward increased with the range and variability of time periods before reward, notably when the liquid was delivered outside of a task. A change in the temporal order of events in a task context produced an increase of response to reward, suggesting an influence of the predicted nature of the event in addition to its time of occurrence. By contrast, we observed no substantial changes in neuronal activity at the expected time of reward when this event failed to occur, suggesting that these neurons do not appear to carry information about an error in reward prediction. These results demonstrate that {TANs} constitute a neuronal system that is involved in detecting unpredicted reward events, irrespective of the specific behavioral situation in which such events occur. The responses influenced by stimulus prediction may constitute a neuronal basis for the notion that striatal processing is crucial for habit learning.},

	abstract = {Responses to an imperative stimulus ({IS}) are especially fast when they are preceded by a warning signal ({WS}). When the interval between {WS} and {IS} (the foreperiod, {FP}) is variable, reaction time ({RT}) is not only influenced by the current {FP} but also by the {FP} of the preceding trial. These sequential effects have recently been proposed to originate from a trace conditioning process, in which the individuals learn the temporal {WS}–{IS} relationship in a trial-by-trial manner. Research has shown that trace conditioning is maximal when the temporal interval between the conditioned and unconditioned stimulus is between 0.25 and 0.60 s. Consequently, one would predict that sequential effects occur especially within short {FP} contexts. However, this prediction is contradicted by Karlin [Karlin, L. (1959). Reaction time as a function of foreperiod duration and variability. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 58, 185–191] who did not observe the typical sequential effects with short {FPs}. To investigate temporal preparation for short {FPs}, three experiments were conducted, examining the sequential {FP} effect comparably for short and long {FP}-sets (Experiment 1), assessing the influence of catch trials (Experiment 2) and the case of a very dense {FP}-range (Experiment 3) on sequential {FP} effects. The results provide strong evidence for sequential effects within a short {FP} context and thus support the trace conditioning account of temporal preparation.},

However, the exact nature of the relation between {CNV} and the underlying timing mechanisms is still a topic of discussion. On the one hand, it has been proposed that the {CNV} measured at supplementary motor area ({SMA}) is a direct reflection of the unfolding of time since a perceived onset, whereas other work has suggested that the increased amplitude reflects decision processes involved in interval timing. Strong evidence for the first view has been reported by Macar et al. (1999), who showed that variations in temporal performance were reflected in the measured {CNV} amplitude. If the {CNV} measured at {SMA} is a direct function of the passing of time, habituation effects are not expected. Here we report two replication studies, which both failed to replicate the expected performance-dependent variations. Even more powerful linear-mixed effect analyses failed to find any performance related effects on the {CNV} amplitude, whereas habituation effects were found. These studies therefore suggest that the {CNV} amplitude does not directly reflect the unfolding of time.},

	abstract = {Human decision-making almost always takes place under time pressure. When people are engaged in activities such as shopping, driving, or playing chess, they have to continually balance the demands for fast decisions against the demands for accurate decisions. In the cognitive sciences, this balance is thought to be modulated by a response threshold, the neural substrate of which is currently subject to speculation. In a speed decision-making experiment, we presented participants with cues that indicated different requirements for response speed. Application of a mathematical model for the behavioral data confirmed that cueing for speed lowered the response threshold. Functional neuroimaging showed that cueing for speed activates the striatum and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-{SMA}), brain structures that are part of a closed-loop motor circuit involved in the preparation of voluntary action plans. Moreover, activation in the striatum is known to release the motor system from global inhibition, thereby facilitating faster but possibly premature actions. Finally, the data show that individual variation in the activation of striatum and pre-{SMA} is selectively associated with individual variation in the amplitude of the adjustments in the response threshold estimated by the mathematical model. These results demonstrate that when people have to make decisions under time pressure their striatum and pre-{SMA} show increased levels of activation.},

We thus hypothesized that prestimulus power in the beta frequency band might reflect 'integration readiness' and distinguish trials in which stimuli were successfully integrated from unsuccessful ones. The results showed increased upper beta power (21-30  Hz) prior to successful integration over central and parietal electrodes. This finding supported the idea that increased prestimulus beta power might reflect general control processes that can facilitate integration.},

However, the temporal sequence of the distributed cortical activity contributing to {iCNV} generation remains unclear. During {iCNV} generation, selectively enhanced low-beta activity has been reported. Here we studied the temporal order of activation foci in cortical regions assumed to underlie {iCNV} generation using source reconstruction of low-beta (13–18 Hz) activity. During the {iCNV}, elicited by a cued simple reaction-time task, low-beta power peaked first (750 ms after cue onset) in anterior frontal and limbic regions and last (140 ms later) in posterior areas. This activity occurred 3300 ms before target onset and provides evidence for the temporally ordered involvement of both cognitive-control and motor-preparation processes already at early stages during the preparation for speeded action.},

	abstract = {The author deals with the problem as to why the shortest anticipatory, or ‘fore’-periods in a randomized series of such periods of different durations usually yield the longest reaction times, whereas the fastest reaction times are experienced with the shortest (to a certain limit) fore-periods when the fore-period is maintained constant within each set of trials. A proposed explanation is examined, one based on the increasing probability of delivery of the stimulus with the passage of time following the warning signal in experiments conducted with randomized fore periods of different durations.
This explanation is tested with 13 subjects (each participating twice). It is found that when the factor of increasing probability is eliminated, the shortest fore-periods in the series no longer yield the longest reaction times. The conclusion is drawn that the main reason for the diverging tendencies noted is the information-generating nature of the passage of time following the warning signal in reaction time experiments with randomized foreperiods of different durations.
Finally, four factors are proposed as exerting an influence on the relationship between the fore-period and the reaction time when varying fore-periods are delivered in random order following a rectangular distribution of fore-periods.},

Two target stimuli were asymmetrically distributed over two “peak-{FPs}” and were equally distributed over 13 additional {FPs}.

This paper documents the involvement of the supplementary motor area ({SMA}) in the encoding of target durations by reporting convergent {fMRI} data from motor and perceptual timing tasks. Event-related {fMRI} was used in two temporal procedures, involving (1) the production of an accurate interval as compared to an accurate force, and (2) a dual-task of time and colour discrimination with parametric manipulation of the level of attention attributed to each parameter. The first study revealed greater activation of the {SMA} proper in skilful control of time compared to force. The second showed that increasing attentional allocation to time increased activity in a cortico-striatal network including the pre-{SMA} (in contrast with the occipital cortex for increasing attention to colour). Further, the {SMA} proper was sensitive to the attentional modulation cued prior to the time processing period. Taken together, these data and related literature suggest that the {SMA} plays a key role in time processing as part of the striato-cortical pathway previously identified by animal studies, human neuropsychology and neuroimaging.},

Subjects watched the screen of an oscilloscope on which a spot moved horizontaly. Vertical lines marked (a) the starting point of the spot's course, t 0, and (b) the points in time, t 1 … t 1, at which the stimulus could arrive. In Experiment I five intervals between t 1 and t 1, ranging from 150 to 900 ms were used in different blocks of trials. In Experiment {II} three t 1-t 1 intervals, ranging from 100 to 400 ms mixed in a random way were used. In both cases subjects were asked to react as fast as possible when the stimulus was presented at moment t 1. The time course of preparation was studied when the stimulus arrived at moment(s) t 1. The results show that reaction time reaches a maximum 250 ms after t 1, irrespectively the predictability of the t 1-t 1 interval. It is also shown that an interval of about 1 s was necessary to obtain reaction times as rapid as those observed at moment t 1. The results are discussed in terms of the evolution of an hypothetical “state of preparation” after a maximum which remains unused.},

	title = {Time of day effects on cognitive processing and brain temperature},
	abstract = {Cognitive performance appears to vary as a function of the time of day in which the task is performed. This fluctuation in performance often is related to the circadian rhythm of body temperature. Fluctuations in cognitive performance have also been linked to changes in cerebral blood flow (as measured by brain temperature). This study was designed to determine whether task characteristics are differentially sensitive to time of day effects, resulting in differences in cognitive performance. Also, this study sought to determine if there is a time of day effect on the way in which brain temperature changes as a consequence of task performance. Tympanic membrane ({TM}) thermometry was used to measures changes in {TM} temperature while subjects performed a series of 4 cognitive tasks. {TM} temperature reflects average brain temperature and is an indirect measure of cerebral blood flow ({CBF}). Results showed that, as in previous studies, there is a time of day effect on body temperature. Only measures of short-term memory for word lists demonstrated a significant time of day effect. Results of this study indicate that {CBF} changes as a result of performing specific tasks. These changes in {CBF} are different at different times for the some tasks, even if there is no significant difference in performance. A significant interaction exists between the time of day in which a task is performed, the change in {CBF}, and the way in which the {CBF} changes. Implications for future time of day studies are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2012 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

Tracking multiple intervals can be explained either by assuming multiple internal clocks or by strategic arithmetic using a single clock. The underlying timescale (linear or nonlinear) qualitatively influences the predictions derived from these accounts, as assuming a nonlinear timescale introduces systematic errors in added or subtracted intervals. Here, we present two experiments that provide support for a single clock combined with a nonlinear underlying timescale. When two equal but partly overlapping time intervals had to be estimated, the second estimate was positively correlated with the stimulus onset asynchrony. This effect was also found in a second experiment with unequal intervals that showed evidence of subtraction of intervals. The findings were supported by computational models implemented in a previously validated account of interval timing [Taatgen, N. A., Van Rijn, H., \& Anderson, J. R. (2007).

Particularly, administration of dopamine agonists or antagonists speeds-up or slows down internal passage of time, respectively (Meck, 1996). This co-variations in the dopamine level and clock speed has been typically induced by pharmacological manipulations (e.g., Lustig \&amp; Meck, 2005). However, it has not been assessed whether naturally occurring fluctuations in dopamine level are sufficient for altering interval timing performance. Recent advances in neurophysiology suggest that tonic and phasic changes of dopamine level in cortical-basal ganglia loop can be traced by fluctuations of beta power (Jenkinson \&amp; Brown, 2011). We assessed dopamine levels by measuring the beta power while participants were asked to produce time intervals by two key presses. Both tonic levels of dopamine as measured by the beta power before interval initiation and phasic level of dopamine as measured after the first key-press predict timing performance. These positive correlations between beta power and length of produced intervals support the notion that dopamine plays an important role in interval timing, even in the range of naturally occurring fluctuations.},

Following earlier work that suggested that representations of different time intervals contaminate each other (Grondin, 2005; Jazayeri \& Shadlen, 2010; Jones \& Wearden, 2004), an experiment was conducted in which subjects had to alternate in reproducing two intervals. In two conditions of the experiment, the duration of one of the intervals changed over the experiment, forcing subjects to adjust their representation of that interval, while keeping the other constant. The results show that the adjustment of one interval carried over to the other interval, indicating that subjects were not able to completely separate the two representations. We propose a temporal reference memory that is based on existing memory models (Anderson, 1990). Our model assumes that the representation of an interval is based on a pool of recent experiences. In a series of simulations, we show that our pool model fits the data, while two alternative models that have previously been proposed do not.

	abstract = {Time is a fundamental dimension of life. It is crucial for decisions about quantity, speed of movement and rate of return, as well as for motor control in walking, speech, playing or appreciating music, and participating in sports. Traditionally, the way in which time is perceived, represented and estimated has been explained using a pacemaker accumulator model that is not only straightforward, but also surprisingly powerful in explaining behavioral and biological data. However, recent advances have challenged this traditional view. It is now proposed that the brain represents time in a distributed manner and teiis the time by detecting the coincidental activation of different neural populations.},
